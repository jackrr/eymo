# eymo

Ey(e)mo(uth) is a program that does fun things with a video stream of a face.

## More accurate detection + mouth/other facial features

Switch from haar to a more contemporary system. Will try out candle
(hugging face rust). Example to model off of here:
https://github.com/huggingface/candle/tree/main/candle-examples/examples/yolo-v3

## Todo

- Mouth detection
- Write to virtual camera detectable by other apps (browser cameras, zoom, etc)
- Fun effects
  - Swap eyes and lips
  - Have eyes and lips rotate about the screen


## Other idea spaces to explore

- Background replacement
